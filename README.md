# guilt_motivator
Welcome to Guilt Motivator, a to-do list app for android with peer pressure incentives!
Add a task that you need to get done, a due date, and one or more contacts, and if you don't check it off by the due date we'll send an email to your contact letting them know that you've failed. 
## Help
__How do I get started?__ 

Click the + button to add a task, then save it. If you finish it before the due date, check it off! Otherwise, your friends or family will hear about it.

Be sure to check out the settings, set your name and pronouns so we can refer to you correctly, and choose how mean or explicit you want the emails we send to be.
